# TreeView Parallel Development Results Summary

## Overview
Four AI agents were tasked with creating independent TreeOfLife visualization prototypes. Two agents completed their work, while two encountered behavioral differences that prevented completion.

## Completed Prototypes

### 1. Living River Ecosystem (Sonnet Agent) ✅
- **Status**: Completed
- **Files Created**: Full implementation with types, components, utils, and Storybook stories
- **Key Innovation**: Evolution visualized as flowing aquatic system with particle physics
- **Result File**: `/workspaces/tetraspore-tree-view-sonnet/AGENT_RESULT_tree-view-sonnet.md`
- **How to Test**: `cd ../tetraspore-tree-view-sonnet && npm run storybook`

### 2. Living Tapestry (Opus Agent) ✅
- **Status**: Completed
- **Files Created**: Full implementation with types, components, utils, and Storybook stories
- **Key Innovation**: Evolution as organic woven fabric with threads representing species
- **Result File**: `/workspaces/tetraspore-tree-view-opus/AGENT_RESULT_tree-view-opus.md`
- **How to Test**: `cd ../tetraspore-tree-view-opus && npm run storybook`

## Incomplete Prototypes

### 3. Living Constellation (Gemini 2.5 Pro Agent) ❌
- **Status**: Planning completed, implementation blocked
- **Issue**: Agent stopped after planning phase; attempted restart failed with "Gemini doesn't support --continue in non-interactive mode"
- **Concept**: 3D star map where species are stars forming constellations
- **Recovery Options**:
  1. Run interactively: `cd ../tetraspore-tree-view-gemini && gemini --model gemini-2.5-pro`
  2. Use Claude agent to implement the Gemini concept
  3. Accept as documentation-only contribution

### 4. Time River (Gemini 2.5 Flash Agent) ❌
- **Status**: Planning completed, implementation blocked
- **Issue**: Same as Gemini Pro - stopped after planning, cannot continue in automation
- **Concept**: Time as a flowing river with species as boats/vessels
- **Recovery Options**: Same as above

## Technical Findings

1. **Behavioral Difference**: Gemini models in `--print` mode interpret task completion differently than Claude models. They stop after major planning milestones rather than continuing through implementation.

2. **Automation Limitation**: Gemini's `--continue` flag only works in interactive TUI mode, not in automated `--print` mode, creating a catch-22 for agent orchestration.

3. **Success Pattern**: Claude models (Sonnet, Opus) work well with the current orchestration pattern, completing full implementations autonomously.

## Recommendations

1. **For Immediate Use**: The two completed prototypes (River Ecosystem and Living Tapestry) are ready for evaluation and testing.

2. **For Gemini Concepts**: Consider either:
   - Manual implementation of the documented concepts
   - Interactive sessions with Gemini agents
   - Re-assignment to Claude agents

3. **For Future Orchestration**: When using mixed model orchestration:
   - Prefer Claude models for autonomous implementation tasks
   - Use Gemini models for planning, review, or interactive tasks
   - Document model-specific behavioral patterns
