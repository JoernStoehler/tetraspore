# RFC: Tree of Life Visualization Design Ideas

## Executive Summary

This document explores design improvements for the Tree of Life visualization in Tetraspore, focusing on creating an immersive, game-appropriate visualization that effectively communicates evolutionary relationships while providing engaging gameplay interactions.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. **Layout Constraints**: Fixed 800x400 dimensions don't adapt to screen size
2. **Container Overflow**: SVG content extends beyond its boundaries
3. **Visual Theme**: Light-themed design inappropriate for gaming atmosphere
4. **Limited Interactivity**: Only basic click handlers, no rich interactions
5. **Static Presentation**: No dynamic focus or narrative progression

### Strengths to Preserve
- Clean D3.js implementation
- Smooth zoom/pan functionality
- Clear node type distinctions (birth/alive/extinction)
- Leveled tree structure (one node per species per turn)

## Design Principles for Game-Focused Evolution Trees

### 1. **Immersive Visual Language** (Confidence: 95%)
- Dark, atmospheric theme befitting a cosmic/primordial setting
- Organic, flowing aesthetics suggesting life and growth
- Particle effects and subtle animations for living systems
- Bioluminescent color palette

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure** (Confidence: 90%)
- Start zoomed on current turn's activity
- Reveal history through exploration
- Fog of war for future evolution paths
- Layered information density

### 3. **Narrative Focus** (Confidence: 85%)
- Tree tells a story, not just displays data
- Highlight dramatic moments (mass extinctions, rapid diversification)
- Visual emphasis on player's choices and their consequences

### 4. **Responsive Information Architecture** (Confidence: 98%)
- Full-screen adaptive layout
- Context-sensitive detail levels
- Semantic zoom (show different info at different scales)
- Mobile-responsive design

## Core Feature Ideas

### Visual Features

#### 1. **Dynamic Theme System** (Expected Utility: High, Implementation: Medium)
```typescript
interface ThemeConfig {
  mode: 'cosmic' | 'primordial' | 'technological' | 'mystical';
  palette: {
    background: RadialGradient;  // Deep space to nebula edge
    nodes: {
      birth: PulsingGradient;    // Green with life energy
      alive: FlowingGradient;    // Blue with movement
      extinction: FadingGradient; // Red dissipating to ash
    };
    edges: {
      recent: GlowEffect;        // Bright for recent connections
      ancient: FadeEffect;       // Dim for old lineages
    };
  };
}
```

#### 2. **Atmospheric Background** (Expected Utility: High, Implementation: Low)
- Animated starfield or primordial soup
- Parallax layers for depth
- Subtle particle systems
- Time-of-day progression matching game turns

#### 3. **Node Visualization Enhancements** (Expected Utility: Very High, Implementation: Medium)
- **Size variation**: Node size reflects species population/importance
- **Pulsing animation**: Living species gently pulse
- **Extinction animation**: Nodes fade and scatter when species die
- **Birth animation**: Nodes grow from parent with particle burst
- **Health indicators**: Visual cues for thriving vs struggling species

### Interaction Features

#### 1. **Focus Mode** (Expected Utility: Very High, Implementation: Medium)
- Click species to enter focused view
- Highlight entire lineage (ancestors + descendants)
- Dim unrelated branches
- Show detailed species information panel
- Smooth camera transitions

#### 2. **Time Scrubbing** (Expected Utility: High, Implementation: High)
- Timeline slider to replay evolution
- Watch species emerge and die
- Pause at interesting moments
- Speed controls for playback

#### 3. **Comparison Mode** (Expected Utility: Medium, Implementation: Medium)
- Select 2+ species to compare
- Highlight common ancestors
- Show divergence points
- Display trait differences

#### 4. **Ghost Preview** (Expected Utility: Medium, Implementation: High)
- Preview potential evolution paths
- Show probability clouds for future turns
- Indicate player choice impact zones

### Information Display Features

#### 1. **Contextual Information Layers** (Expected Utility: Very High, Implementation: Medium)
```typescript
interface InfoLayer {
  zoomLevel: number;
  showElements: {
    speciesNames: boolean;
    turnNumbers: boolean;
    populationSize: boolean;
    traits: boolean;
    relationships: boolean;
  };
}

// Zoom levels:
// 0.3-0.7: Overview (only major branches)
// 0.7-1.5: Standard (names and turns)
// 1.5-3.0: Detailed (all information)
```

#### 2. **Rich Tooltips** (Expected Utility: High, Implementation: Low)
- Hover for quick info
- Species traits and abilities
- Population statistics
- Evolutionary pressure indicators
- Player actions that affected this species

#### 3. **Legend and Controls** (Expected Utility: High, Implementation: Low)
- Collapsible legend
- View options (show/hide elements)
- Search/filter capabilities
- Keyboard shortcuts overlay

### Performance Features

#### 1. **Level-of-Detail Rendering** (Expected Utility: High, Implementation: High)
- Render only visible nodes in detail
- Simplified rendering for distant nodes
- Progressive loading for large trees
- WebGL acceleration for complex effects

#### 2. **Smart Clustering** (Expected Utility: Medium, Implementation: High)
- Group dense areas at low zoom
- Expand on zoom/interaction
- Maintain performance with 1000+ nodes

## UX Patterns for Gaming Context

### 1. **Cinematic Transitions** (Confidence: 85%)
- Camera movements tell story
- Smooth focus shifts between game events and tree
- Dramatic zooms for extinctions/births

### 2. **Persistent Player Context** (Confidence: 90%)
- Always show player's current focus species
- Breadcrumb trail of player choices
- Quick return to "home" view

### 3. **Integrated Game Actions** (Confidence: 80%)
- Right-click for species actions menu
- Drag to create relationships
- Double-click to view species detail screen

### 4. **Visual Feedback Loops** (Confidence: 95%)
- Immediate visual response to game events
- Ripple effects through the tree
- Satisfying animations for player actions

## Technical Considerations

### 1. **Rendering Strategy**
- **Canvas vs SVG**: Consider hybrid approach
  - SVG for interactive elements
  - Canvas for effects and backgrounds
  - WebGL for particle systems

### 2. **State Management**
- Efficient tree updates without full re-renders
- Optimistic updates for responsiveness
- State persistence for time scrubbing

### 3. **Responsive Design**
```typescript
interface ViewportStrategy {
  mobile: {
    orientation: 'vertical';
    controls: 'bottom-sheet';
    zoom: 'pinch-gesture';
  };
  tablet: {
    orientation: 'auto';
    controls: 'sidebar';
    zoom: 'pinch-or-wheel';
  };
  desktop: {
    orientation: 'horizontal';
    controls: 'floating-panels';
    zoom: 'wheel-or-buttons';
  };
}
```

## Specific Solutions to Current Issues

### 1. **Full-Screen Adaptive Layout**
```typescript
// Replace fixed dimensions with viewport-based sizing
const { width, height } = useViewportSize();
const treeContainer = {
  width: width - sidebarWidth,
  height: height - headerHeight,
  minWidth: 320,
  minHeight: 480
};
```

### 2. **Container Overflow Fix**
- Implement proper SVG viewBox
- Add pan boundaries
- Clip-path for edge cases
- Overflow indicators at boundaries

### 3. **Dark Gaming Theme**
```css
.tree-of-life {
  background: radial-gradient(ellipse at center, 
    #0a0e1a 0%,     /* Deep space core */
    #1a1f3a 50%,    /* Nebula middle */
    #0d1117 100%);  /* Dark edge */
  
  /* Subtle animated stars */
  &::before {
    content: '';
    background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml,...'); /* Generated stars */
    animation: twinkle 200s linear infinite;
  }
}
```
