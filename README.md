# Tetraspore

**Guide the evolution of life across alien worlds.**

Tetraspore is an interactive evolution simulation game where you shape the development of life from simple organisms into complex ecosystems. Using AI-driven game mechanics, explore how species adapt, evolve, and survive across different planetary environments.

## What is Tetraspore?

üß¨ **Evolution Simulation**: Start with basic organisms like moss and guide their evolution through millions of years of planetary history.

üåç **Alien Worlds**: Explore different planets, each with unique environmental challenges and evolutionary pressures.

ü§ñ **AI Game Master**: An intelligent system generates realistic species mutations, environmental events, and evolutionary scenarios.

üå≥ **Tree of Life**: Visualize evolutionary relationships in an interactive tree showing how species branch, adapt, and sometimes go extinct.

‚ö° **Real-time Decisions**: Make strategic choices about how your species respond to environmental challenges with immediate visual feedback.

üîÑ **Time Travel**: Rewind and replay evolutionary history to experiment with different choices and see alternate outcomes.

## Key Features

### Core Gameplay

- **Species Evolution**: Watch simple organisms develop complex traits and behaviors
