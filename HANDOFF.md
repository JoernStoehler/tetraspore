# Choice Cards Feature Handoff
## Completed by: feat/choice-cards agent
## Date: 2025-07-19
## Status: Complete and ready for integration

### What was implemented:

#### Core Components
- **ChoiceCard Component** (`src/components/game/ChoiceCard.tsx`)
  - Displays individual choice with title, description, category badge, and flavor text
  - Shows prerequisites as chips when present
  - Includes cost display and interactive select button
  - Disabled state with lock overlay for locked choices
  - Responsive design with hover and tap animations
  - Full keyboard accessibility

- **ChoiceList Component** (`src/components/game/ChoiceList.tsx`)
  - Grid layout with responsive columns (1/2/3 based on screen size)
  - Category filtering tabs with choice count badges
  - Smooth animations for filtering transitions
  - Empty state messaging
  - Summary stats showing total and available choices
  - Animated tab switching with spring physics

#### Type System
- **Choice Types** (`src/types/choices.ts`)
  - Extended existing Choice interface from state.ts with ChoiceWithUI
  - Added cost and disabled properties for UI functionality
  - Category colors and display names configuration
  - Maintains compatibility with existing game state types

#### Mock Data
- **Sample Choices** (`src/data/mockChoices.ts`)
  - 10 diverse example evolution choices across all categories
  - Realistic progression with prerequisites
  - Engaging flavor text and descriptions
  - Mix of available and locked choices for testing

### Integration points:

#### App Integration
- Added Choice Cards demo accessible via "Choice Cards" button in dev mode
- Integrated with existing App.tsx routing system
- Console logging for choice selection (ready for game store integration)

#### Styling System
- Uses existing Tailwind CSS configuration
- Consistent dark mode support throughout
- Category-specific color coding:
  - Physical: Green tones
  - Cognitive: Blue/purple tones
  - Social: Yellow/orange tones
  - Technological: Cyan/silver tones

#### Animation Framework
- Added framer-motion dependency
- Smooth micro-interactions and page transitions
- Staggered animations for choice grid
- Spring-based tab switching

### Next steps:

#### Game Integration
1. Connect choice selection to game store and event system
2. Implement actual choice unlocking logic based on prerequisites
3. Add resource cost validation and deduction
4. Create choice effect implementation (traits, abilities, etc.)

#### Enhanced Features
1. Search/filter functionality beyond categories
2. Choice comparison view
3. Progress tracking and choice history
4. Sound effects and enhanced animations

#### Testing
1. Add unit tests for ChoiceCard and ChoiceList components
2. Add integration tests for choice selection flow
3. Add accessibility testing for keyboard navigation

### How to test:

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
# Click "New Game" to initialize
# Click "Choice Cards" to view the implemented system
```

#### Component Testing
```bash
npm test         # Run existing test suite
npm run lint     # Check code quality
npm run build    # Verify TypeScript compilation
```

#### Features to Test
1. **Category Filtering**: Click category tabs to filter choices
2. **Choice Interaction**: Hover over cards, click to select
3. **Responsive Design**: Resize window to test grid layout
4. **Accessibility**: Use keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
5. **Animations**: Watch smooth transitions between categories
6. **Disabled States**: Observe locked choices with overlay

### Technical Notes:

#### Dependencies Added
- `framer-motion@^12.23.6` for animations

#### File Structure
```
src/
├── components/game/
│   ├── ChoiceCard.tsx      # Individual choice display
│   ├── ChoiceList.tsx      # Grid + filtering
│   └── index.ts           # Component exports
├── data/
│   └── mockChoices.ts     # Sample data
└── types/
    └── choices.ts         # Type definitions
```

#### Code Quality
- All TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ESLint clean (no warnings)
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility best practices
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

### Known Limitations:
1. Choice selection only logs to console (awaiting game store integration)
2. Prerequisites checking is visual-only (needs game logic)
3. Cost system defined but not connected to resource management
4. No persistence of choice selections between sessions

The choice cards system is complete and ready for integration with the game's core mechanics.
