# UI Layout and Navigation Handoff

## Completed by: feat/ui-layout
## Date: 2025-07-19
## Status: âœ… Complete - Ready for integration

### What was implemented:

**Core Layout System:**
- `AppLayout` component with fixed navigation bar and responsive design
- `ViewRouter` for managing view transitions
- Keyboard shortcuts (T, M, C) for quick navigation
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

**View Components (Functional Placeholders):**
- `TreeView` - Evolution tree visualization placeholder with species stats
- `MapView` - Region map placeholder with interactive region selection
- `ChoicesView` - Current choices placeholder with categorized choice cards

**State Management Integration:**
- Updated `ViewType` to include 'choices' view
- Full integration with `uiStore` for view state management
- Preserved existing UI state (selectedRegion, selectedSpecies, etc.)

**App Flow:**
- Landing page when game not initialized (preserved existing new game flow)
- Main layout with navigation when game is active
- Smooth transitions between views

### Integration points:

**For Tree Visualization Agent:**
- Replace `TreeView` component content with actual D3.js tree visualization
- Use existing species data from `gameStore.species`
- Maintain responsive container structure

**For Choice Cards Agent:**  
- Replace `ChoicesView` component content with interactive choice cards
- Use existing `gameStore.activeChoices` data
- Maintain category-based styling and selection logic

**For Map Agent:**
- Replace `MapView` component content with actual map visualization  
- Use existing regions data from `gameStore.regions`
- Maintain region selection integration with `uiStore.selectedRegion`

**Required Interfaces:**
- Views expect game data from Zustand stores (`useGameStore`, `useUIStore`)
- Navigation state managed via `uiStore.setView(viewType)`
- All components follow existing Tailwind styling patterns

### Next steps:

**Immediate (Other Wave 1 Agents):**
- Tree visualization agent can replace TreeView content
- Choice cards agent can replace ChoicesView content  
- Map agent can replace MapView content

**Future Enhancements:**
- Add view-specific loading states
- Implement view history/breadcrumbs
- Add view-specific keyboard shortcuts
- Enhance mobile gesture navigation

### How to test:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test navigation (after starting new game)
# - Click Tree/Map/Choices buttons
# - Use T/M/C keyboard shortcuts
# - Test responsive behavior

# Verify builds and tests pass
npm run lint
npm run build  
npm test -- --run
```

### Key Files:

**New Components:**
- `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Main layout with navigation
- `src/components/views/ViewRouter.tsx` - View routing logic
- `src/components/views/TreeView.tsx` - Tree placeholder (replace me!)
- `src/components/views/MapView.tsx` - Map placeholder (replace me!)
- `src/components/views/ChoicesView.tsx` - Choices placeholder (replace me!)

**Modified Files:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated new layout system
- `src/types/state.ts` - Added 'choices' ViewType
- `src/App.test.tsx` - Updated for new version number

**Ready for Enhancement:**
All view components are designed as placeholder containers that can be replaced with actual implementations while maintaining the navigation and responsive structure.
