# Code Review Task: Tree Visualization and LLM Service

You are a code reviewer with fresh eyes. Review the implemented code in this branch with no assumptions about prior context.

## Review Scope

Review the code implementation in this branch, focusing on:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Clean, maintainable code
   - Proper error handling
   - Performance considerations (especially for tree visualization)
   - Security (especially for LLM service)

2. **Architecture Adherence**
   - Check against ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md in the repo
   - Verify no unauthorized architectural changes were made
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns

3. **Documentation Clarity**
   - Is HANDOFF.md clear to someone who didn't implement it?
   - Are APIs and interfaces well-documented?
   - Is the mock/real mode switch clear for LLM service?

4. **Integration Readiness**
   - Will this integrate smoothly with main branch?
   - Are visualization components properly isolated?
   - Is the LLM service properly abstracted?

5. **Special Considerations**
   - For Tree Viz: Performance with large trees, responsive design
   - For LLM Service: API key handling, rate limiting, mock quality

## Review Process

1. Start by reading HANDOFF.md - is it clear without prior context?
2. Review the actual implementation files
3. For Tree Viz: Test with different tree sizes and interactions
4. For LLM Service: Test both mock and real modes (if API key available)
5. Check error scenarios and edge cases

## Output

Create a REVIEW_REPORT.md with:
- Summary of findings
- Any critical issues that must be fixed
- Performance or security concerns
- Suggestions for improvements
- Confirmation of what works well
- Integration risks or concerns

Be especially critical of any architectural decisions that weren't in the original spec.
