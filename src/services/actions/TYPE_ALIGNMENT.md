# Type Alignment Documentation

## Background

During the integration of the action system components, we discovered type mismatches between the parser and executor components. These components were developed separately and had different assumptions about certain enum values.

## Type Mismatches Found

### Animation Types
- **Parser**: `'none' | 'slow_zoom' | 'pan_left' | 'pan_right' | 'fade'`
- **Executor**: `'fade_in' | 'zoom_in' | 'pan_left' | 'pan_right' | 'static'`

### Voice Tone Types
- **Parser**: `'epic' | 'calm' | 'mysterious' | 'urgent' | 'triumphant'`
- **Executor**: `'epic' | 'calm' | 'mysterious' | 'urgent'` (missing 'triumphant')

## Resolution

We aligned on the parser's type definitions for the following reasons:

1. **Semantic Clarity**: The parser's animation names (`slow_zoom`, `fade`) are more descriptive than the executor's (`zoom_in`, `fade_in`)
2. **Cutscene Player Compatibility**: The cutscene player component expects the parser's animation values
3. **Completeness**: The parser included all necessary voice tones including 'triumphant'

## Changes Made

1. Updated executor types to match parser definitions
2. Modified example JSON files to use the correct enum values
3. Added type aliases to ensure consistency: `Action as ExecutorAction`

## Future Recommendations

To prevent such issues:
1. Create a shared types package that all components import
2. Define enums in a single location
3. Use TypeScript's const assertions for literal types
4. Consider using branded types for stronger type safety

## Impact

The type alignment ensures:
- Type safety across the entire pipeline
- Correct validation of user input
- Proper execution of animations in the cutscene player
- Support for all voice variations in audio generation
