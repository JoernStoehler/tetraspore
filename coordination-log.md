# Coordination Log

This log tracks all agent coordination activities, decisions, and outcomes. Each orchestrator should update this when spawning agents or making integration decisions.

## Format
- Date - Feature/Task (Orchestrator: Name)
- Agents spawned with models and assignments
- Integration outcomes
- Key decisions and rationale

## 2025-07-20 - Agent Orchestration System (Orchestrator: Claude)

### Agents Spawned
None - working directly in main branch

### Work Completed
- Created `.claude/commands/orchestrator-prompt.md` - initialization prompt for orchestrators
- Created `.claude/commands/workagent-prompt.md` - initialization prompt for workagents  
- Restructured `docs/agent-orchestration-guide.md` - reduced by ~50%, clearer structure
- Added 1:1:1 relationship documentation (workagent ↔ branch ↔ worktree)
- Created `.claude/commands/tasks/` directory for future task templates

### Decisions
- Used thin wrapper approach for prompts to avoid documentation duplication
- Renamed from philosophical "you-are-*" to actionable "*-prompt.md"
- De-emphasized mail system as agents often forget to use it
- Clarified that workagents don't need HANDOFF.md (they own their branch entirely)

### Integration
- Direct commits to main (no feature branches needed for documentation)

## Template for Future Entries

## YYYY-MM-DD - Feature Name (Orchestrator: Name)

### Agents Spawned
- `feat/branch-name` (model) - Task description
- `feat/other-branch` (model) - Task description

### Work Completed/In Progress
- What was accomplished
- Current status of branches

### Decisions
- Architecture choices made
- Rationale for parallelization strategy
- Model selection reasoning

### Integration
- Merge strategy used
- Conflicts resolved
- Testing outcomes

## 2025-07-20 - Project Progress Tracking System (Orchestrator: Claude)

### Agents Spawned
None - working directly in main branch

### Work Completed
- Created project progress tracking system to maintain continuity across sessions
- Renamed specification.md → project-status.md (better reflects agile/living document)
- Created coordination-log.md (this file) to track agent coordination history
- Created docs/project-guide-progress-tracking.md explaining the tracking system
- Updated orchestrator and workagent prompts in .claude/commands/
- Restructured docs/agent-orchestration-guide.md (50% shorter, clearer)

### Decisions
- Chose "project-status" over "specification" to avoid waterfall connotations
- Chose "coordination-log" over "orchestration-log" to focus on who/what/where
- Used thin wrapper approach for agent prompts to avoid documentation duplication
- De-emphasized mail system as agents often forget to use it reliably

### Integration
- Direct commits to main (documentation and tooling changes only)
- No feature branches required

---

## 2025-01-20 - DSL Architecture Implementation (Orchestrator: Claude)

### Context
Major architecture pivot from event-sourcing to DSL-driven system based on RFC_DSL_FOR_LLM_DRIVEN_GAMEDYNAMICS.md

### Agents Spawned
- `feat/dsl-game-core` (opus) - Implement DSL system and game logic
- `feat/tree-viz` (opus) - Implement tree of life visualization

### Work Completed
- ✅ Complete DSL system with parser, validator, reducer
- ✅ Two-pass LLM validation with feedback
- ✅ Component registry for UI integration
- ✅ Zustand game store with mock LLM
- ✅ D3.js tree visualization with 4 node types
- ✅ Interactive preview nodes for player choices

### Mistakes & Lessons
- **Branch Reuse**: Used existing `feat/tree-viz` branch (violates 1:1:1)
- **No Communication**: Agents didn't send mail (not instructed to)
- **Infinite Loops**: Used `while true` for monitoring
- **Tool Improvements**: Enhanced workagent with stream-json and smart status

### Decisions
- Pivoted to DSL architecture for LLM-driven UI
- Used flattened TreeNode type instead of separate arrays
- Added comprehensive orchestrator safeguards to docs

### Integration
- Both branches ready for merge
- Need to wire TreeView into DSL registry
- Test mock LLM game flow
