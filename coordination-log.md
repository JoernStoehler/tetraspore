# Coordination Log

This log tracks all agent coordination activities, decisions, and outcomes. Each orchestrator should update this when spawning agents or making integration decisions.

## Format
- Date - Feature/Task (Orchestrator: Name)
- Agents spawned with models and assignments
- Integration outcomes
- Key decisions and rationale

## 2025-07-20 - Agent Orchestration System (Orchestrator: Claude)

### Agents Spawned
None - working directly in main branch

### Work Completed
- Created `.claude/commands/orchestrator-prompt.md` - initialization prompt for orchestrators
- Created `.claude/commands/workagent-prompt.md` - initialization prompt for workagents  
- Restructured `docs/agent-orchestration-guide.md` - reduced by ~50%, clearer structure
- Added 1:1:1 relationship documentation (workagent ↔ branch ↔ worktree)
- Created `.claude/commands/tasks/` directory for future task templates

### Decisions
- Used thin wrapper approach for prompts to avoid documentation duplication
- Renamed from philosophical "you-are-*" to actionable "*-prompt.md"
- De-emphasized mail system as agents often forget to use it
- Clarified that workagents don't need HANDOFF.md (they own their branch entirely)

### Integration
- Direct commits to main (no feature branches needed for documentation)
