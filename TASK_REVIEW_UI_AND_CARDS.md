# Code Review Task: UI Layout and Choice Cards

You are a code reviewer with fresh eyes. Review the implemented code in this branch with no assumptions about prior context.

## Review Scope

Review the code implementation in this branch, focusing on:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Clean, maintainable code following React best practices
   - Proper TypeScript usage and type safety
   - No unnecessary complexity

2. **Architecture Adherence**
   - Check against ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md in the repo
   - Verify no unauthorized architectural changes were made
   - Ensure proper use of existing stores and event system

3. **Documentation Clarity**
   - Is HANDOFF.md clear to someone who didn't implement it?
   - Are component interfaces well-documented?
   - Would another developer understand how to use these components?

4. **Integration Readiness**
   - Will this integrate smoothly with main branch?
   - Are there any hidden dependencies or assumptions?
   - Check for potential conflicts with other features

5. **Testing & Quality**
   - Are tests adequate and meaningful?
   - Run `npm test` and `npm run lint`
   - Check TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`

## Review Process

1. Start by reading HANDOFF.md - is it clear without prior context?
2. Review the actual implementation files
3. Run the dev server (`npm run dev`) and test the UI
4. Check for any code smells or concerns
5. Look for any hardcoded values that should be configurable

## Output

Create a REVIEW_REPORT.md with:
- Summary of findings
- Any critical issues that must be fixed
- Suggestions for improvements
- Confirmation of what works well
- Integration risks or concerns

Focus on actionable feedback. Be thorough but constructive.
