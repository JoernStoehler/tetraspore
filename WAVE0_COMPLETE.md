# Wave 0: Core Infrastructure - Complete ✓

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Event System (`src/stores/eventStore.ts`)
- ✅ EventStore with Zustand + localStorage persistence
- ✅ Event validation with TypeScript discriminated unions
- ✅ Methods: recordEvent(), getEvents(), getEventsSince()
- ✅ Automatic persistence to localStorage
- ✅ Redux DevTools integration

### 2. Type Definitions (`src/types/`)
- ✅ All event types from specification
- ✅ GameState, Species, Region, Feature interfaces
- ✅ UI state types (ViewType, UIState)
- ✅ Event validation helpers

### 3. Zustand Stores
- ✅ **gameStore.ts**: Core game state management
  - initializeGame() creates primordial life
  - processTurn() advances game
  - updateFromEvent() for incremental updates
  - rebuildFromEvents() for full state reconstruction
  
- ✅ **uiStore.ts**: UI state management
  - View switching (main/tree/map/history)
  - Selection tracking (region/species/choice)
  - Loading state management

### 4. State Projection (`src/services/stateProjection.ts`)
- ✅ Rebuilds complete game state from event log
- ✅ Handles all event types appropriately
- ✅ Maintains referential integrity between entities
- ✅ Efficient incremental updates

### 5. Integration & Testing
- ✅ Stores wired up in App.tsx
- ✅ Development helpers (window.gameStore for debugging)
- ✅ Test page created to verify functionality
- ✅ Build passes, tests pass
- ✅ Dev server runs without errors

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Zustand for Everything**: Consistent state management pattern
2. **Event Sourcing**: All changes go through events
3. **TypeScript Discriminated Unions**: Type-safe event handling
4. **localStorage Persistence**: Simple, works offline
5. **Redux DevTools**: Great debugging experience

## How to Test

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Click "New Game" - creates initial species and region
3. Click "Test Event" - adds a test feature
4. Open console and use: `window.gameStore()`, `window.eventStore()`
5. Refresh page - data persists via localStorage

## Ready for Wave 1

The core infrastructure is complete and stable. All Wave 1 agents can now:
- Import types from `src/types`
- Use stores via hooks from `src/stores`
- Record events that automatically update game state
- Build UI components that react to state changes

Next step: Spawn Wave 1 parallel agents!
